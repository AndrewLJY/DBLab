Welcome!

## Labs
Your project consists of four labs. You are *strongly advised* to start early.  

* [Lab 1](lab1.md): due **June 29 11.59pm (week 6)**.
* [Lab 2](lab2.md): due **June 13 11.59pm (week 8)**.

Each lab is given **12 points**: **9** for passing all the tests, and **3** for the report. 

## Important
In addition to the academic integrity policy (as discussed in the lecture), take note that: 
* You cannot make your Github repository for the labs public. 
* You cannot copy and paste code from other people or any other sources. 
* You cannot share your solutions.
